Plain Old Pointers

Pointers with nothing extra:

- No pointee type information.
- No mutability type information.
- No type co- or contravariance.
- No excluded auto traits.
- No niches.
- No undefined behavior when computing a derived pointer.
- No pointer metadata.

# Rationale

## Lack of Type Information

## Wrapping Arithmetic
